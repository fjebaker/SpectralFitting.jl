    abstract type AbstractDataLayout end

The data layout primarily concerns the relationship between the objective and
the domain. It is used to work out whether a model and a dataset are fittable,
and if not, whether a translation in the output of the model to the domain of
the model is possible.

The following methods may be used to interrogate support:
- [`preferred_support`](@ref) for inferring the preferred support of a model when multiple supports are possible.
- [`common_support`](@ref) to obtain the common support of two structures

The following method is also used to define the support of a model or dataset:
- [`supports`](@ref)

For cases where unit information needs to be propagated, an `AbstractDataLayout` can also be used to ensure the units are compatible. To query the units of a layout, use
- [`support_units`](@ref)

    support_units(x)

Return the units of a particular layout. If this method returns `nothing`,
assume the layout does not care about the units and handle that information
appropriately (throw an error or set defaults).
